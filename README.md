# Coding Challenges

Hey there, my name is Harold Gonzalez, I'm a Software Engineer and I want to share some Computer Science Challenges with you! In this repository you will find different challenges and my solutions. 

## How to run the challenges

0. I write most of my code with Javascript, so you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed in your machine.
1. Clone the repository from your terminal using:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/haroldcng/coding-challenges.git
```
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the algorithm you are interested on.
```sh
$ cd coding-challenges/path/to/awesome/algorithm/
```
3. Execute the algorithm.
```sh
$ node algorithm-file-name.js
```
That will show you some sort of output, generally in your terminal.
