# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed.

First, I'm not being paid or something like that. I just think this is such an awesome book to practice with. It gives you such valuable information, tech-wise and job-wise.

In this folder I'm going to upload some of my answers of the problems proposed in the book. Again, just the **answers**. Gayle has done an awesome job with this book, so if you want to understand what the problems are about, learn more theory and all the cool stuff, show some love and get the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/).
